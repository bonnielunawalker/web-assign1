##### What is this?

This project is the culmination of three assignments for my first year web development class. The finished product isn't the nicest of all time - there are errors in my PHP and my JS isn't the nicest it could be. However, based on the timeframe I had to complete the task, I'm happy with it, and I learned a lot during the process. I mostly keep it here for posterity.
